# CodSoft Internship Project

This repository contains the internship task project for CodSoft. The project includes three web pages developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript: a calculator, a landing page, and a portfolio.

## Calculator

The calculator page (`calculator.html`) allows users to perform basic arithmetic calculations. It provides a user-friendly interface with buttons for numbers, operators, and a display to show the result. The calculator's functionality is implemented using JavaScript.

To run the calculator page, simply open the `calculator.html` file in a web browser.

## Landing Page

The landing page (`landing-page.html`) serves as an introduction to the project. It showcases the key features of the project and provides a brief overview. The design and layout of the landing page are implemented using HTML and CSS, with possible interactive elements using JavaScript.

To view the landing page, open the `landing-page.html` file in a web browser.

## Portfolio

The portfolio page (`portfolio.html`) showcases the developer's work, skills, and experience. It includes sections for project highlights, a brief bio, contact information, and links to relevant social media profiles. The styling and layout of the portfolio page are implemented using HTML and CSS, with potential interactivity using JavaScript.

To explore the portfolio, open the `portfolio.html` file in a web browser.
## Folder Structure

The project folder is structured as follows:
index.html
calculator.html
landing-page.html
portfolio.html
css/
styles.css
js/
calculator.js
images/
[relevant images]
 The `index.html` file serves as the main entry point and could provide links to each of the three pages.
- The `css/` folder contains the CSS stylesheets for each page.
- The `js/` folder includes JavaScript files for implementing functionality specific to the calculator page.
- The `images/` folder stores relevant images used in the project.

Feel free to explore the code and make any modifications as needed.
